XBee MicroPython Libraries
==========================

This directory contains MicroPython modules that you can use in your
applications to benefit from the methods and abstractions they offer.
Libraries are organized in categories, which are directories that group them
by feature or functionality. 

**XBee MicroPython plugin for PyCharm** uses this folder to list and import
libraries when creating a new project.
