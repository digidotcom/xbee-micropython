PWM Duty Cycle Sample Application
=================================

This example demonstrates the usage of the PWM API by giving an example of
how to control the duty cycle of the PWM channel of the XBee device.

The example waits for a button press to start the duty cycle sequence. This
sequence increases gradually the value of the duty cycle to its maximum and
then decreases it gradually to its minimum.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 radio module with MicroPython support.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).
* One PWM peripheral (RGB LED, buzzer, DC servo, etc.)

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.
2. Connect the PWM device to the `RSSI PWM/DIO10` pin of the XBee module. The
   way to connect it changes depending on the carrier board you have:

   * XBIB-U-DEV board:

     * In XBIB-U-DEV boards the `RSSI PWM/DIO10` is already connected to the
       RSSI LEDs tower of the board. So, you don't need to connect anything in
       order to test the sample.

   * XBIB-C board:

     * Isolate the `RSSI PWM/DIO10` pin so it does not use the
       functionality provided by the board.
     * Connect the PWM device to the `RSSI PWM/DIO10` pin and to GND.

   **NOTE**: It is recommended to verify the capabilities of the pins used in
   the example as well as the electrical characteristics in the product manual
   of your XBee Device to ensure that everything is configured correctly.

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to compile and
launch the application. Follow these steps to test the sample:

1. Press the start button (**SW2** in XBIB-U-DEV carrier board or **Comm DIO0**
   in XBIB-C carrier board) to start the duty cycle sequence. This sequence
   increases gradually the value of the duty cycle to its maximum and then
   decreases it gradually to its minimum.
2. Verify that the output of the peripheral varies during the sequence. In the
   case of the RSSI LEDs tower of the XBIB-U-DEV board, LEDs should start
   turning on gradually from the bottom to the top and then turning off from
   the top to the bottom.
