I2C EEPROM Sample Application
=============================

This example demonstrates the usage of the I2C API by giving an example
of how to read and write data from/to an EEPROM memory connected to the I2C
interface of the XBee module.

The application erases the EEPROM memory, writes some data and reads the memory
again to verify the written data.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 radio module with MicroPython support.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).
* One I2C EEPROM device.

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.
2. Connect the EEPROM device to the I2C interface of the XBee module. The way to
   connect the sensor changes depending on the carrier board you have:

   * XBIB-U-DEV board:

     * Isolate the pins configured as SDA and SCL so they do not use the
       functionality provided by the board.
     * Connect the I2C device to VCC, to the pins configured as SDA and SCL
       and to GND. See the following table for more information about the pins
       layout:

           +--------+------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
           | Signal | Pin ID     | Pin # TH | Pin # SMT | Pin # MMT |
           +--------+------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
           | SDA    | PWM1/DIO11 | 7        | 8         | 8         |
           +--------+------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
           | SCL    | AD1/DIO1   | 19       | 32        | 30        |
           +--------+------------+----------+-----------+-----------+

   * XBIB-C board:

     * If your EEPROM device has a Grove connector, connect it directly to the
       `Grove I2C/DIO/ADC` connector of the XBIB-C board.
     * Otherwise, follow the instructions for the XBIB-U-DEV board.

   **NOTE**: It is recommended to verify the capabilities of the pins used in
   the example as well as the electrical characteristics in the product manual
   of your XBee Device to ensure that everything is configured correctly.

Run
---

Before launching the application, you need to set four parameters that depend
on the specific I2C EEPROM device you have:

* Address of the slave device.
* Addressing size (generally 8 o 16 bits).
* Maximum data size in read/write operations.
* Time to wait between operations.

Once you have done that, all you need to do is to compile and launch the
application.

The application erases the first part of the memory by writing `0xFF` bytes and
then reads it. Verify that the output is the following (the number of `\xff`
will vary depending on the configured max size):

    Erasing flash...

    b'\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff
    \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff
    \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff
    \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff
    \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff
    \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff
    \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff'

Then, the application writes `Hello World!` at index 0 and reads again the
memory. Verify that the written data is located first, and the rest is still
`\xff`:

    Writing 'Hello World!' to flash...

    b'Hello World!\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff
    \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff
    \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff
    \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff
    \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff
    \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff
    \xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff'
