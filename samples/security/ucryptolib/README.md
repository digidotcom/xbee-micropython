ucryptolib Sample Application
======================================

This example demonstrates the usage of the ucryptolib built-in module
by performing the AES128 and AES256 test vectors from NIST SP800-38A
for the CBC and CTR cipher modes.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 radio module with MicroPython support.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to compile and
launch the application.

When run the test will report which test vector suite is being run and
should also print the string "Pass" indicating that the vector
encrypted and decrypted correctly.


Supported platforms
-------------------

* Digi XBee3 Cellular LTE-M/NB-IoT - minimum firmware version: 11415
* Digi XBee3 Cellular LTE Cat 1 - minimum firmware version: x15
