Bluetooth Client Read and Write Sample Application
==================================================

This example demonstrates the usage of the XBee's BLE client indicate/notify
feature.
The example connects to a Silicon Labs Thunderboard and configures it to
send the XBee information about the state of the on-board buttons.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 radio module with MicroPython support.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).
* A Silicon Labs [Thunderboard React](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/thunderboard/thunderboard-react-kit-sensor-cloud-connectivity)

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.
2. Turn on the Thunderboard and press button SW-0 to make it connectable by
   pressing the SW-0 button. LED-B will begin to blink indicating that the
   Thunderboard is ready for a connection.

Run
---

The example needs to be configured. Enter the BLE address of the
Thunderboard React. The sample makes a connection to the
Thunderboard and discover its I/O characteristics. It then configures the
Thunderboard to send a notification whenever either one of its buttons are
pressed or released.
After configuration, compile and launch the application.
The sample starts out printing the target BLE address:
`Attempting connection to: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx`
Once the connection is made a `connected` message will be printed.
Following that, anytime a button is pressed on the Thunderboard, a
corresponding message will be printed.
For example:
```
Button SW-0 was pressed
Button SW-0 was released
Button SW-1 was pressed
Button SW-1 was released
```
