End to End Tank Monitoring IoT Sample Application
=================================================

This example is part of the Digi's End-to-End Tank Monitoring IoT demo. It
demonstrates how to use the XBee 3 Cellular modules to communicate with Digi
Remote Manager and use the BLE interface to talk to mobile apps applied to
the tank monitoring vertical.

In theory, the XBee 3 Cellular module this example runs in corresponds to a
tank controller and is connected to the following peripherals but, for
demonstration purposes, they are emulated:
  * Level sensor.
  * Electronic valve.

The example performs the following actions:
  * Listen for BLE connections to execute the provisioning process (initial
    configuration of the tank controller properties).
  * Read the values of the sensors and upload them to Digi Remote Manager
    periodically.
  * Listen for requests coming from Digi Remote Manager and execute the proper
    actions.

Read the demo documentation for more information.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* At least one XBee 3 Cellular module and its corresponding carrier board
  (XBIB-C board).
* A smartphone running the corresponding mobile app of the demo.
* A Digi Remote Manager account. Go to https://myaccount.digi.com/ to create it
  if you do not have one.

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly. For each XBee 3 Cellular module:

1. Plug the XBee 3 Cellular radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it
   to your computer's USB port.
2. Make sure the XBee3 cellular device is connected to Internet. To do so,
   verify that the Connection status LED is blinking or the value of the
   **AI** parameter is **0**.
3. Using XCTU, enable the *"Always remain connected to Digi Remote Manager 
   through TCP"* feature by setting the **MO** parameter to **7**. This way The
   device remains connected to Digi Remote Manager while you test the sample.
4. Make sure the XBee3 cellular device is connected to Digi Remote Manager. To
   do so, verify that the value of the **DI** parameter is **0**, **5** or
   **6**.

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is build and launch
the project. Then, read the demo documentation for more information about how
to test the demo.
