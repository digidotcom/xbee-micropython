Prevent Sleep Sample Application
================================

This example demonstrates the usage of the Power Management API by giving an
example of how to prevent the module to go to sleep from MicroPython code.

When the XBee device is configured to sleep (**SM** is different than **0** or
**6**) and it enters sleep mode, any MicroPython code currently executing is
suspended until the device comes out of sleep. When the XBee device comes out
of sleep mode, MicroPython execution continues where it left off.

This example demonstrates how to force the device to stay awake during critical
operations using the `XBee().wake_lock`. For that purpose the example exposes 2
counters of 10 units, one that can be interrupted and other that cannot because
is being executed inside the `wake_lock`.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 radio module with MicroPython support.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).
* The XCTU application (available at www.digi.com/xctu).

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.
2. Using XCTU configure the sleep options of the module to **sleep for 10
   seconds** and **wake for 4 seconds**. To do so configure the following
   parameters:
   
       SM: Cyclic Sleep [4] - Wakes on timer expiration
       SP: 3E8              - 10 seconds
       ST: FA0              - 4 seconds 
       SO: 2                - Always wake for ST time

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to compile and 
launch the application.

**Note**: Before discovering the device or launching the application you must
either **reset** the module or **press the commissioning** button to make sure
the module is not sleeping to communicate with it. 

While the application is running verify that the `interruptable counter` is
interrupted when the module goes to sleep (up to 3 times until the counter
reaches 10) but the `not interruptable counter` is never interrupted although
the mode wants to go to sleep.

    ...
    --------------------
    Interruptable counter: 1
    (Module goes to sleep here for 10 seconds)
    Interruptable counter: 2
    Interruptable counter: 3
    Interruptable counter: 4
    Interruptable counter: 5
    (Module goes to sleep here for 10 seconds)
    Interruptable counter: 6
    Interruptable counter: 7
    Interruptable counter: 8
    Interruptable counter: 9
    (Module goes to sleep here for 10 seconds)
    Interruptable counter: 10
    --------------------
    Not interruptable counter: 1
    Not interruptable counter: 2
    Not interruptable counter: 3
    Not interruptable counter: 4
    Not interruptable counter: 5
    Not interruptable counter: 6
    Not interruptable counter: 7
    Not interruptable counter: 8
    Not interruptable counter: 9
    Not interruptable counter: 10
    --------------------
    Interruptable counter: 1
    (Module goes to sleep here for 10 seconds)
    Interruptable counter: 2
    Interruptable counter: 3
    Interruptable counter: 4
    Interruptable counter: 5
    (Module goes to sleep here for 10 seconds)
    Interruptable counter: 6
    ...

After you've finished testing the example remember to restore the sleep options
of the module to their default values using XCTU.
