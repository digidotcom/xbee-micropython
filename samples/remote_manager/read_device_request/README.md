Read Device Request Sample Application
======================================

This example demonstrates the usage of the Digi Remote Manager API by giving
an example of how to poll for device requests from your Digi Remote Manager
account to toggle an LED.

The example reads device requests from your Digi Remote Manager account using
the `device_request_receive()` method and, when a device request containing the
text **TOGGLE_LED** is received, it toggles the status of the
**ON/SLEEP/DIO9** LED.

Due to the nature of the project (receive a device request at any time), the
XBee3 cellular device should remain connected to Digi Remote manager through
TCP. This is, the SM/UDP feature should be disabled.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 cellular module with MicroPython support.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).
* A Digi Remote Manager account with the XBee3 cellular device registered in.
* The XCTU application (available at www.digi.com/xctu).

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 cellular module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.
2. Make sure the XBee3 cellular device is connected to Internet. To do so,
   verify that the Connection status LED is blinking or the value of the
   **AI** parameter is **0**.
3. Using XCTU, enable the *"Always remain connected to Digi Remote Manager 
   through TCP"* feature by setting the **MO** parameter to **7**. This way The
   device remains connected to Digi Remote Manager while you test the sample. 
4. Make sure the XBee3 cellular device is connected to Digi Remote Manager. To
   do so, verify that the value of the **RI** parameter is **0**.

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to compile and 
launch the application. When executed, it starts reading device requests from
your Digi Remote Manager account.

Follow these steps to test the application:

1. Log in your Digi Remote Manager account using your credentials: 
   https://remotemanager.digi.com/login.do
2. Within the Digi Remote Manager platfotm, go to the **Documentation** Tab
   and then select the **API Explorer** option.
3. Click the **SCI Targets** button and choose your XBee3 Cellular device from
   the drop-down list. Then, click **Add** to add it to the list of target
   devices and click **OK** to apply.
4. Click the **Examples** button and select **SCI > Data Service >
   Send Request** to fill the code box with a device request example.
5. Change the value of the attribute **target_name** to **micropython** and   
   replace the **my payload string** text with **TOGGLE LED**. The request
   should look similar to:
   
       <sci_request version="1.0">
         <data_service>
           <targets>
             <device id="XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX"/>
           </targets>
           <requests>
             <device_request target_name="micropython"> 
               TOGGLE LED
             </device_request>
           </requests>
         </data_service>
       </sci_request>
   
6. Click **Send** button (fill the account credentials if asked to do so) to
   send the device request to the XBee3 Cellular device.
7. The example should have received the device request. Verify that the
   **ON/SLEEP/DIO9 LED** has toggled its status and the answer to the device
   request sent is **LED TOGGLED**.

When finished testing the example, you should restore the status of the
*"Always remain connected to Digi Remote Manager through TCP"* feature (**MO**
parameter) to the value it had before running the example.
