DRM HTTP Requests Sample Application
====================================

This example demonstrates the usage of the 'remotemanager' library by giving
an example of how to create a datastream and upload datapoints to your Digi
Remote Manager account using HTTP API of the platform.

Instead of calling the internal Digi Remote Manager API, this example uses a
library to communicate with Digi Remote Manager through HTTP requests.

The example creates a datastream and then reads and uploads the temperature of
the module every 30 seconds to the configured Digi Remote Manager account. 

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 Cellular module with MicroPython support and a micro SIM card
  inserted with Internet capabilities.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).
* A Digi Remote Manager account. XBee3 Cellular module does not need to be
  registered or connected to Digi Remote Manager.
* The XCTU application (available at www.digi.com/xctu).

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.
2. Make sure the XBee3 cellular device is connected to Internet. To do so,
   verify that the Connection status LED is blinking or the value of the
   **AI** parameter is **0**.
3. Update the values of `DRM_USER` and `DRM_PASS` constants within the code of
   the example with your Digi Remote Manager account credentials.

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to compile and
launch the application. When executed, the application creates the datastream
and starts uploading samples there. The output should look like this:

    - Creating datastream 'xbee_temperature'... [OK]
    - Uploading datapoint to datastream 'xbee_temperature'... [OK]
    - Uploading datapoint to datastream 'xbee_temperature'... [OK]
    - Uploading datapoint to datastream 'xbee_temperature'... [OK]
    - Uploading datapoint to datastream 'xbee_temperature'... [OK]
    - Uploading datapoint to datastream 'xbee_temperature'... [OK]

Follow these steps to verify samples are actually uploaded to your Digi Remote
Manager account:

1. Log in your Digi Remote Manager account using your credentials: 
   https://remotemanager.digi.com/login.do
2. Within the Digi Remote Manager platfotm, go to the **Data Services** tab
   and select the **Data Streams** option.
3. Look for the stream **xbee_temperature**.
4. Select the stream and verify the chart displays the temperature of the
   module as it is being sent.
