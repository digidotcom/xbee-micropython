Send Data Points Sample Application
===================================

This example demonstrates the usage of the Digi Remote Manager API by giving
an example of how to upload data points to your Digi Remote Manager account.

The example reads the temperature of the module every 5 seconds, creates a
`DataPoints` object and uploads it to your Digi Remote Manager account.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 cellular module with MicroPython support.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).
* A Digi Remote Manager account with the XBee3 cellular device registered in.
* The XCTU application (available at www.digi.com/xctu).

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 cellular module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.
2. Make sure the XBee3 cellular device is connected to Internet. To do so,
   verify that the Connection status LED is blinking or the value of the
   **AI** parameter is **0**.
3. Make sure the XBee3 cellular device is connected to Digi Remote Manager. To
   do so, verify that the value of the **RI** parameter is **0**.

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to compile and 
launch the application. When executed, it starts reading and uploading the
temperature of the XBee module to your Digi Remote Manager account every 5
seconds.

Follow these steps to verify the temperature is being uploaded to your Digi
Remote Manager account:

1. Log in your Digi Remote Manager account using your credentials: 
   https://remotemanager.digi.com/login.do
2. Within the Digi Remote Manager platfotm, go to the **Data Services** tab
   and select the **Data Streams** option.
3. Look for the stream **`<device_id>`/mp_xbee_temperature** where `<device_id>`
   is the ID of your XBee3 cellular device within your account.
4. Select the stream and verify the chart displays the temperature of the
   module as it is being sent.

Supported platforms
