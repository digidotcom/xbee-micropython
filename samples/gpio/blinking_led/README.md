Blinking LED Sample Application
===============================

This example demonstrates the usage of the I/O pins API by giving an example
of how to initialize and manage the status of an I/O pin.

The example toggles the status of an LED every second.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 radio module with MicroPython support.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to compile and
launch the application.

Verify the LED corresponding to the configured pin (`ON/SLEEP/DIO9`) in the
carrier board starts blinking (toggles its status every second). Every time
the LED toggles, the application indicates it through the XBee REPL console:

    - LED ON
    - LED OFF
    - LED ON
    - LED OFF
