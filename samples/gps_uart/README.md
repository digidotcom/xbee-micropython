GPS UART Sample Application
===========================

This example demonstrates the usage of the UART API by giving an example
of how to read data from a GPS connected through the UART interface to
display the current position.

The example reads GPS data from the secondary UART of the module every 30
seconds, extracts the values of latitude and longitude from the read data
and displays them. 

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 Cellular module with MicroPython support.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).
* A GPS board.

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.
2. Connect the secondary UART interface of the XBee device to the serial
   interface of the GPS board. See the following table for more information
   about the secondary UART pins layout on the XBee modules:

           +--------+------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
           | Signal | Pin ID     | Pin # TH | Pin # SMT | Pin # MMT |
           +--------+------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
           | TX     | DIO4       | 11       | 24        | 23        |
           +--------+------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
           | RX     | DIO12      | 4        | 5         | 5         |
           +--------+------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
           | RTS    | AD2/DIO2   | 18       | 31        | 29        |
           +--------+------------+----------+-----------+-----------+
           | CTS    | AD3/DIO3   | 17       | 30        | 28        |
           +--------+------------+----------+-----------+-----------+

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to compile and
launch the application.

The application displays the values of latitude and longitude every 10 seconds:

    - Reading GPS data... [OK]
    - Latitude:
    - Longitude:
    --------------------------------
    - Reading GPS data... [OK]
    - Latitude:
    - Longitude:
    --------------------------------
    - Reading GPS data... [OK]
    - Latitude:
    - Longitude:
    --------------------------------
