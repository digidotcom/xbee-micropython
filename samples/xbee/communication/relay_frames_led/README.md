Relay Frames LED Sample Application
===================================

This example demonstrates the usage of the User Data Relay frames API by giving
an example of how to read a relay frame and turn on/off an LED.

The example waits for a User Data Relay, parses it and turns on or off the
On/Sleep LED depending on the data received (`'ON'` or `'OFF'`).

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 radio module with MicroPython support.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).
* The XCTU application (available at www.digi.com/xctu).

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is build and launch
the project. Once the application is running (application header is displayed
in the XBee REPL console), execute the following steps to test it:

1. Disconnect the XBee REPL console.
2. Open XCTU application and add your XBee device to the list of radio modules.
3. Change the operating mode of the module to **API** by configuring the **AP**
   setting with **1**.
4. Switch to the **Consoles** working mode and open the serial connection with
   the module so you can see frames when they are received.
5. Create and add a frame to the **Send Frames** list using the **Frames
   Generator** tool with the following parameters:

       - Frame type:       0x2D - User Data Relay
       - Frame ID:         01
       - Dest. interface:  MicroPython [02]
       - RF data (ASCII):  ON

6. Send the frame generated by selecting it and clicking the **Send selected
   Frame** button.
7. Verify that the On/Sleep LED of the XBee carrier board is on.
8. Create and add a frame to the **Send Frames** list using the **Frames
   Generator** tool with the following parameters:

       - Frame type:       0x2D - User Data Relay
       - Frame ID:         01
       - Dest. interface:  MicroPython [02]
       - RF data (ASCII):  OFF

9. Send the frame generated by selecting it and clicking the **Send selected
   Frame** button.
10. Verify that the On/Sleep LED of the XBee carrier board is off.

When finished, restore the operating mode of the module to **MicroPython**
by configuring the **AP** setting with **4** using XCTU.
