Wi-SUN Get Started Sample Application
=====================================

This example is part of the Digi's Wi-SUN Get Started. It demonstrates
how to use the XBee Hive Wi-SUN and the XBee Wi-SUN modules to exchange
data using the socket IPv6 API.

This application is executed in the XBee Wi-SUN module and performs the
following actions:
  * Listens for incoming IPv6 messages on port 0x2616 (9750).
  * Converts the payload to uppercase.
  * Sends the modified message back to the senderâ€™s address.

Read the [demo documentation][doc] for more information.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* An XBee Wi-SUN radio module with MicroPython support.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-C board).
* An XBee Hive Wi-SUN device running the corresponding Python application of the
  Get Started.

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee 3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is build and launch
the project. Then, read the demo documentation for more information about how
to test the demo.

Supported platforms
