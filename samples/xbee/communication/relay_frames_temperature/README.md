Relay Frames Temperature Sample Application
===========================================

This example demonstrates the usage of the User Data Relay frames API by giving
an example of how to send and receive data to the Bluetooth Low Energy
interface.

The example waits for a User Data Relay message to start reading the temperature
and humidity from the XBIB-C carrier board sensor. Then, it sends the values to
the XBee Bluetooth interface at the specified rate.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 radio module with MicroPython support.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-C board).
* The XCTU application, version 6.4.2 or newer
  (available at www.digi.com/xctu).
* An Android or iOS device with the 'XBee BLE MicroPython' sample installed.


Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.

2. Enable the Bluetooth interface of the XBee device and configure the
   Bluetooth authentication using XCTU.
   For further information on how to perform this task, refer to the
   XCTU user manual.

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is build and launch
the project. Then, launch the 'XBee BLE MicroPython' sample of the Digi Mobile
SDK and follow the instructions explained in that sample's README file.
