AT Commands Sample Application
==============================

This example demonstrates the usage of AT commands by giving an example
of how to read and configure several parameters on the XBee.

The example reads the firmware version, hardware version, temperature and
configures the node identifier.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 radio module with MicroPython support.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to compile and
launch the application.

Verify that the console shows the firmware and hardware versions, temperature
and node identifier:

    Firmware version: 0x11410
    Hardware version: 0x4b44
    The XBee is 22.0 C (71.6 F)
    Configured node identifier: XBee3 module
