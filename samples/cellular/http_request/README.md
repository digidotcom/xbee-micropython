HTTP Request Sample Application
===============================

This example demonstrates the usage of the socket API by giving an example of
how to send an HTTP request.

The example waits until the module is connected to the cellular network. After
that, it sends the HTTP request to the MicroPython web site and dumps the
response in the console.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee3 Cellular module with MicroPython support and a micro SIM card
  inserted with Internet capabilities.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to compile and
launch the application.

When the module has joined the cellular network, you should see the HTTP
response in the console, similar to the following:

    Requesting /ks/test.html from host www.micropython.org...

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Server: nginx/1.10.3
