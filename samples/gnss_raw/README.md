GNSS Module Sample Application
===========================

This example demonstrates the usage of the GNSS raw NMEA API by
reporting the NMEA data stream for a short period of time to the
terminal.

Requirements
------------

To run this example you need:

* One XBee 3 Global LTE-M/NB-IoT Cellular module and GNSS antenna.
* One carrier board for the radio module (XBIB-U-DEV or XBIB-C board).

Setup
-----

Make sure the hardware is set up correctly:

1. Plug the XBee3 radio module into the XBee adapter and connect it to your
   computer's USB port.
2. Install the GNSS antenna to the appropriate u.fl connector.

Run
---

The example is already configured, so all you need to do is to compile and
launch the application.


Supported platforms
