        * ``"mac"``: Get the device BLE MAC address as a ``bytes`` object.
          (This is equivalent to querying the ATBL AT command.)

    Start or stop GAP advertisements from the XBee3 module.

    **Stop advertising:**

    To stop advertising, set ``interval_us`` to ``None``. Example::

        from digi import ble
        ble.gap_advertise(None)

    **Return to default advertisement:**

    If ``adv_data`` is empty (i.e. ``b''``), then GAP advertising will return
    to the default XBee behavior, which is to advertise the product name
    (e.g. ``XBee3 Zigbee``) and ``interval_us`` is ignored.::

        ble.gap_advertise(500000, b'')

    **Specify new advertisement data:**

    If ``adv_data`` is given and is not ``None`` or empty (i.e. ``b''``),
    then it should consist of one or more Advertising Data (AD) elements,
    as defined in the Bluetooth Core Specification Supplement, Part A Section 1.
    The format of Advertising Data elements is summarized here:
      * Each AD element consists of a length byte, a data type byte, and
        one or more bytes of data. The length byte indicates how long the rest
        of the element is, e.g. a Complete Local Name element with the value
        ``"My XBee"`` would have a length byte ``0x08`` - 1 byte for type plus
        7 bytes for the value.
      * The Bluetooth SIG provides the list of defined Advertising Data element types
        at https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers/generic-access-profile/

    Please be aware that in order to advertise a specific device name (such as ``"My XBee"``),
    ``adv_data`` cannot consist simply of the name to be advertised.
    The ``adv_data`` value *must* be formatted as one or more Advertising Data elements
    in order to be interpreted as a valid Bluetooth Low Energy advertisement by other devices.

    Example::

        ble.gap_advertise(200000, b"\x08\x09My XBee")

        # Example using a bytearray
        name = b"My XBee"
        data = bytearray([len(name) + 1, 0x09])
        data.extend(name)
        ble.gap_advertise(200000, data)

    **Re-use data from the previous gap_advertise call:**

    If ``adv_data`` is ``None`` or not specified, then the data passed to the
    previous call to ``gap_advertise`` will be re-used, unless there was no
    previous call or the data was empty, in which case the behavior will be
    as if an empty value (``b''``) was passed.::

        # These two calls are equivalent.
        ble.gap_advertise(200000)
        ble.gap_advertise(200000, None)

    :param interval_us: Start advertising at the specified interval, in microseconds.
        This value will be rounded down to the nearest multiple of 625 microseconds.
        If this value is not ``None``, it must be at least 20,000 microseconds
        (20 milliseconds) and no larger than 40,959,375 microseconds
        (approximately 40.96 seconds).
        To stop advertising, set ``interval_us`` to ``None``.
    :param adv_data: The payload that will be included in GAP advertisement broadcasts.
        ``adv_data`` can be a ``bytes`` or ``bytearray`` object up to 31 bytes in length,
        or ``None``.

    * ``payload``: The raw advertisement payload, formatted as a ``bytes`` object.

    **Accessing the received advertisements:**

    One way to access the advertisements received during a GAP scan operation
    is to call the ``get()`` method on the scan object, which returns a list
    of advertisements::

        scan = ble.gap_scan()
        # Pause for a few seconds to allow some advertisements to arrive.
        time.sleep(5)
        for advertisement in scan.get():
            print(advertisement)
        scan.stop()

    Continue reading for other examples of accessing the advertisements.

    **Using gap_scan as an iterator:**

    Instead of calling ``get()`` repeatedly to access received GAP advertisements,
    the object returned by ``gap_scan`` may be used as an iterator, or in other words,
    as the target of a ``for``-loop::

        scan = ble.gap_scan(duration_ms=10000)  # 10 seconds
        for advertisement in scan:
            print(advertisement)

    Using ``gap_scan`` as an iterator is the preferred means to access the
    received advertisements. This is because calling ``get()`` requires allocating a list
    and filling the list with advertisements (dictionaries), whereas using ``gap_scan``
    as an iterator is more efficient because only one dictionary needs to be created at a time.

    To stop iterating over the ``gap_scan`` object (in order for your MicroPython application
    to perform other activities, for example), just ``break`` out of the loop. The GAP scan
    will continue running in the background. Example::

        # Example: read and print out 5 advertisements at a time
        def process_five_advertisements(scan):
            count = 0
            for advertisement in scan:
                print(advertisement)
                count += 1
                if count >= 5:
                    break

        scan = ble.gap_scan()
        while True:
            process_five_advertisements()
            do_something_else()
        scan.stop()

    **Using gap_scan as a context manager:**

    When running an indefinite GAP scan operation (``duration_ms=0``), instead of
    needing to call ``stop()`` to end the GAP scan operation, you may instead use
    the object returned by ``gap_scan`` as a context manager. By doing this,
    when the ``with`` block is exited, the GAP scan operation is automatically stopped.
    This approach uses less code and is less error-prone.

    For example, if you want to run a GAP scan operation until any advertisement whose
    payload contains a particular byte string is found, you can do this as follows::

        def find_advertisement(search):
            with ble.gap_scan(0) as scan:
                for adv in scan:
                    if search in adv["payload"]:
                        return adv

        found = find_advertisement(b"Hello, XBee")

    Compare to this example which does not use a context manager. Note the use of a try/finally block,
    and the need to call ``stop()`` explicitly::

        def find_advertisement(search):
            scan = ble.gap_scan(0)
            try:
                for adv in scan:
                    if search in adv["payload"]:
                        return adv
            finally:
                # Make sure to call stop() even if an exception is raised.
                scan.stop()

        found = find_advertisement(b"Hello, XBee")

    :param duration_ms: The duration of the GAP scan operation, i.e. how long to scan, in milliseconds.
        To scan indefinitely, set this to 0. If this parameter is not specified, it defaults
        to 0 (indefinite scan).
    :param interval_us: Optionally configure the duty cycle of the GAP scan operation.
        The scanner will run for ``window_us`` microseconds every ``interval_us`` microseconds.

    A GAP connection can be used to discover the services and characteristics
    supported by the connected peripheral device, and to interact with the
    device's characteristics by reading or writing values, or interacting with
    notifications and indications.

    **Close a connection:**

    To disconnect from a connected peripheral device, call the ``close()``
    method on the GAP connection object. Example::

        connection = ble.gap_connect(ble.ADDR_TYPE_PUBLIC, mac)
        # perform some activities with the connection
        connection.close()

    The GAP connection object will no longer be usable. Making a new connection
    requires calling ``gap_connect()`` again.

    **Using gap_connect as a context manager:**

    If a GAP connection object is left open (for example, if you connected
    to a device in a function but did not call ``close()``), resources in the
    XBee will continue to be used in servicing the connection until the
    connection object is deleted, either by soft-resetting the MicroPython REPL,
    or by garbage collection. (Note: Manually triggering garbage collection by
    using ``gc.collect()`` is typically not necessary in MicroPython.)

    Instead of needing to call ``close()`` directly, you may instead use the
    object returned by ``gap_connect`` as a context manager. By doing this,
    when the ``with`` block is exited, the GAP connection is automatically closed.
    This approach uses less code and is less error-prone, because ``close()`` will
    be called even if an exception is raised.

    For example, if you want to connect to a peripheral, discover and print its
    services, then close the connection, you can do this as follows::

        def show_services(addr_type, address):
            with ble.gap_connect(addr_type, address) as peripheral:
                for service in peripheral.gattc_services():
                    print(service)

        show_services(ble.ADDR_TYPE_PUBLIC, mac)

    Compare to this example which does not use a context manager. Note the use of
    a try/finally block, and the need to call ``close()`` explicitly::

        def show_services(addr_type, address):
            peripheral = ble.gap_connect(addr_type, address)
            try:
                for service in peripheral.gattc_services():
                    print(service)
            finally:
                # Make sure to call close() even if an exception is raised.
                peripheral.close()

        show_services(ble.ADDR_TYPE_PUBLIC, mac)

    **gap_scan and gap_connect:**

    Any ongoing GAP scan operation (see ``gap_scan()``) will block a GAP
    connection request until the scan completes. If the scan does not complete
    within ``timeout_ms``, the ``gap_connect`` call will raise OSError ETIMEDOUT.

    Starting a GAP scan operation while a GAP connection is open is allowed
    and does not affect the existing GAP connection.

    **timeout_ms parameter:**

    The ``timeout_ms`` parameter specifies the maximum length of time that the
    ``gap_connect`` call should be allowed to block waiting for the connection
    to be established. Note that per the Bluetooth Core Specification, if the
    remote device does not respond to a connection request within six (6)
    connection intervals, the connection shall be considered lost.
    In other words, the connection attempt can time out in less time than
    specified in ``timeout_ms``, depending on the connection interval used.
    See the ``interval_ms`` parameter for ``digi.ble.config()`` for more
    information on the connection interval setting.

    **Note:**

    The ``gap_connect`` function is new in the following firmware versions:
        * XBee3 Zigbee: version 100A
        * XBee3 802.15.4: version 200A

        * XBee3 Cellular LTE Cat 1: version 31015

    :param addr_type: The type of address contained in the ``address`` value.
        The possible values are defined as constants on the ``digi.ble`` module:
            * ``ADDR_TYPE_PUBLIC``
            * ``ADDR_TYPE_RANDOM``
            * ``ADDR_TYPE_PUBLIC_IDENTITY``
            * ``ADDR_TYPE_PUBLIC_RANDOM``
    :param address: The BLE MAC address to connect to. The address is a ``bytes`` object,
        and is 6 bytes (48 bits) long.
    :param timeout_ms: Specifies the maximum time to wait before giving up on
        a connection attempt.
    :param interval_us: Optionally configure the duty cycle of the GAP scan operation
        used to discover the remote device.
        The scanner will run for ``window_us`` microseconds every ``interval_us`` microseconds.
        ``window_us`` must be less than or equal to ``interval_us``.
        ``interval_us`` must be at least 2,500 microseconds (2.5 milliseconds)
        and no more than approximately 40.96 seconds (40,959,375 microseconds).
        The default interval is 20 milliseconds.
    :param window_us: Optionally configure the duty cycle of the GAP scan operation
        used to discover the remote device.

    :param onclose: When specified, indicates a function which will be called when
        the connection closes. The first argument to this callback is the
        connection returned by this function (gap_connect). The second
        argument is an error code. The error codes are taken from the
        Bluetooth Core specification Vol 2, Part D (Error Codes).

    :return: An object which encapsulates the GAP connection.
    :raises OSError ETIMEDOUT: The connection attempt timed out.
    :raises OSError ENOTCONN: The connection attempt failed for an unknown reason.
