    If the device is operating in MicroPython REPL (**AP** is set to **4**) and
    the receive queue is full, it silently rejects any additional incoming
    packets; the sending node will receive a transmission status of **0x24**
    (Address not found) in this case.

    It's recommended to call the ``receive()`` function in a loop so no data is
    lost. On devices where there is a high volume of network traffic, there
    could be data lost if the messages are not pulled from the queue fast
    enough.

        * The constant ``xbee.ADDR_BROADCAST`` to indicate a broadcast
          destination.
        * The constant ``xbee.ADDR_COORDINATOR`` to indicate the coordinator.

        There are multiple ways to create the 8-byte bytes object for 64-bit

        * As a bytestring: ``b'\\x00\\x13\\xa2\\x00\x41\\x74\\x07\\xa6'``.

          ``bytes([0, 19, 162, 0, 65, 116, 7, 166])``.
        * Using the ``bytes()`` constructor with a tuple of hex values:
          ``bytes((0x00, 0x13, 0xa2, 0x00, 0x41, 0x74, 0x07, 0xa6))``.

def poll_now() -> None:
  """
  Polls for messages sent while the device was asleep or the radio idle.

  In order to receive data while the radio is idled, the MicroPython
  application must periodically call xbee.poll_now() to check for
  incoming data. Calling poll_now() will cause the radio to check for
  messages stored by its parent, and will retrieve a single message from
  the parent if any are available. xbee.poll_now() doesn't return the
  retrieved packetâ€”the packet is instead passed to MicroPython via the
  normal method, either by the application calling xbee.receive() or
  through a callback if one is registered.

  **Note**: xbee.poll_now() is a non-blocking call, meaning it will
  return before the polling is complete. It can take about 10 ms after
  calling poll_now() before a message is available to xbee.receive().

  It is recommended to register a callback for received packets when
  using xbee.poll_now(). That way, once the packet is retrieved from the
  parent it will be immediately handled by the application.

  Since xbee.poll_now() only retrieves a single packet from the parent,
  it may need to be called more than once if more than one message may
  be received between polls. One way to do so is by calling
  xbee.poll_now() again every time a packet is received, or in the
  receive callback.

  **Note**: This function is only available on XBee3 Zigbee modules with
  version 100B or newer.
